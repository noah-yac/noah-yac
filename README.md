Hello GitHub users!
  I am currently studying at Macomb Community College, and plan to transfer to Oakland University or Michigan Tech University this 2022 Winter Semester.
Ever since I was young I have always found computers to be really neat. Learning about what you can make them do, and how they function is really absorbing. 
The amount of subject matter you can learn about computers is seemingly infinite. As I've grown up I've watched all kinds of computers and what they're capable of evolve around me, 
and it has me excited to continue learning and pursuing education.
